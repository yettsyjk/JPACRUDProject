## Reason for this application:
- :man_health_worker: Helping Patients Feel Heard
:woman_health_worker:
:health_worker:
- MySQL table for patient information that follows HIPAA guideline. Allowing front office staff and healthcare staff to have a "bottom line up front" plan of care for the patient attended.


### Main Lessons Learned
1. Database MySQL: Mapping entities to SQL one table
1. Spring Tool Suite4 JPA using JPQL: Creating Spring Model View Controller project to JPA project
1. Spring Tool Suite4 Spring Boot Project: Having the controller makes the Spring Boot Not so front-end. However, not sure how to have the client see java server pages.(My thought process) Perhaps reviewing documentation to answer if jsp can be seen from the JPA side. hmm.
1. Remote learning due to COVID course decision to stay remote: certainly has been a struggle. Not sure what questions to ask. However, our cohort is asking questions that get some wheels spinning.
1. JUnit Jupiter: course introduction JUnit testing 4 weeks ago or so and now re-emphasizing JUnit testing and test driven development for the only entity (Patient.java).
1. CREATE READ UPDATE DELETE operations. Yikes.
1. Bootstrap CSS for front-end: This course is heavy back-end and for that reason I leaned on Bootstrap CSS library to make an alright front-end for client. I can certainly spend more time understanding grids and containers within Bootstrap or other CSS libraries.

## Fun Times
``java.lang.IllegalStateException: Optional int parameter 'id' is present but cannot be translated into a null value due to being declared as a primitive type. Consider declaring it as object wrapper for the corresponding primitive type.``

## User Stories MVP
## User Story 1:
- Your project utilizes a MySQL database to manipulate data. For this project you are only required to have a single table and entity.

## User Story 2:
- The MySQL table is mapped to a valid JPA Entity and tested to ensure the mappings are working correctly.

## User Story 3:
- A Spring project allows for a user to perform basic CRUD operations on your entity via a web interface.

## User Story 4:
- Your project and database are deployed to your AWS instance.
- My laptop tanked almost two weeks ago and I'm using a loaner so I don't think I can reach this story.

## MVP+
- create user login page
- client side styling

## Technologies Used:
- SpringToolSuite4
- JUnit Test
- Java Version 1.8
- mySQL, mySQL Workbench, and SQL
- Spring Boot, Hibernate, Gradle, JSP
- Bootstrap, HTML, CSS
- Git and Github for version control
- Zoom, Slack
